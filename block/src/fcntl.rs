//! Helpers for advisory file locking.
//!
//! Under the hood, the implementation uses OFD locks for the entire file,
//! as described in [[0]]. The advantage over `F_SETLKW` (currently used by
//! Rust std: `File::try_lock()`) is that only the very last `close()` on a
//! file descriptor releases the lock. This prevents mistakes and unexpected
//! behavior.
