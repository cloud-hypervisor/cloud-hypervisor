# Fuzzing in Cloud Hypervisor

Cloud Hypervisor uses [cargo-fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) for fuzzing individual components.

The fuzzers are are in the `fuzz/fuzz_targets` directory

## Preparation

Switch to nightly: 

````
rustup override set nightly
````

Install `cargo fuzz`: 

```
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## Running the fuzzers

e.g. To run the `qcow` fuzzer using all available CPUs:

```
cargo fuzz run qcow -j `nproc`
```

## Adding a new fuzzer

```
cargo fuzz add <new_fuzzer>
```
