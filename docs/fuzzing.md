# Fuzzing in Cloud Hypervisor

Cloud Hypervisor uses [cargo-fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) for fuzzing individual components.

The fuzzers are in the `fuzz/fuzz_targets` directory

## Preparation

Switch to nightly: 

````
rustup override set nightly
````

Install `cargo fuzz`: 

```
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## Running the fuzzers

e.g. To run the `block` fuzzer using all available CPUs:

```
cargo fuzz run block -j `nproc`
```

## Adding a new fuzzer

```
cargo fuzz add <new_fuzzer>
```

Inspiration for fuzzers can be found in [crosvm](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/+/refs/heads/master/fuzz/)

## Fuzzing disk image formats

The `disk_*` targets share a format agnostic framework in
`fuzz/src/disk_engine`. It fuzzes the disk image engine of the `block`
crate: everything between the point where untrusted image bytes are parsed
(`factory::open_disk` and the per format constructors) and the trait contract
the rest of the VMM consumes (`disk_file::AsyncFullDiskFile` and
`async_io::AsyncIo`). Virtio request parsing sits above that boundary and is
covered by the `block` target instead.
