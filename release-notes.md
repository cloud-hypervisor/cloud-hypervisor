# v0.1.0

This release has been tracked through the [0.1.0 project](https://github.com/intel/cloud-hypervisor/projects/1).

Highlights for `cloud-hypervisor` version 0.1.0 include:

### Shared filesystem

We added support for the [virtio-fs](https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/) shared file
system, allowing for an efficient and reliable way of sharing a filesystem
between the host and the `cloud-hypervisor` guest.

See our [filesystem sharing](https://github.com/intel/cloud-hypervisor/blob/master/docs/fs.md)
documentation for more details on how to use virtio-fs with `cloud-hypervisor`.

### Initial direct device assignment support

VFIO (Virtual Function I/O) is a kernel framework that exposes direct device
access to userspace. `cloud-hypervisor` uses VFIO to directly assign host
physical devices into its guest.

See our [VFIO](https://github.com/intel/cloud-hypervisor/blob/master/docs/vfio.md)
documentation for more detail on how to directly assign host devices to
`cloud-hypervisor` guests.

### Userspace IOAPIC

`cloud-hypervisor` supports a so-called split IRQ chip implementation by
implementing support for the [IOAPIC](https://wiki.osdev.org/IOAPIC).
By moving part of the IRQ chip implementation from kernel space to user space,
the IRQ chip emulation does not always run in a fully privileged mode.

### Virtual persistent memory

The `virtio-pmem` implementation emulates a virtual persistent memory device
that `cloud-hypervisor` can e.g. boot from. Booting from a `virtio-pmem` device
allows to bypass the guest page cache and improve the guest memory footprint.

### Linux kernel bzImage

The `cloud-hypervisor` linux kernel loader now supports direct kernel boot from
`bzImage` kernel images, which is usually the format that Linux distributions
use to ship their kernels. For example, this allows for booting from the host
distribution kernel image.

### Console over virtio

`cloud-hypervisor` now exposes a `virtio-console` device to the guest. Although
using this device as a guest console can potentially cut some early boot
messages, it can reduce the guest boot time and provides a complete console
implementation.

The `virtio-console` device is enabled by default for the guest console.
Switching back to the legacy serial port is done by selecting
`--serial tty --console off` from the command line.

### Unit testing

We now run all unit tests from all our crates directly from our CI.

### Integration tests parallelization

The CI cycle run time has been significantly reduced by refactoring our
integration tests; allowing them to all be run in parallel.
