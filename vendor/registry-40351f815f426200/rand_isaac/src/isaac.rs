/// A random number generator that uses the ISAAC algorithm.
///
/// ISAAC stands for "Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count" which are
/// the principal bitwise operations employed. It is the most advanced of a
/// series of array based random number generator designed by Robert Jenkins
/// in 1996[^1][^2].
///
/// ISAAC is notably fast and produces excellent quality random numbers for
/// non-cryptographic applications.
///
/// In spite of being designed with cryptographic security in mind, ISAAC hasn't
/// been stringently cryptanalyzed and thus cryptographers do not not
/// consensually trust it to be secure. When looking for a secure RNG, prefer
/// [`Hc128Rng`] instead, which, like ISAAC, is an array-based RNG and one of
/// the stream-ciphers selected the by eSTREAM contest.
///
/// In 2006 an improvement to ISAAC was suggested by Jean-Philippe Aumasson,
/// named ISAAC+[^3]. But because the specification is not complete, because
/// there is no good implementation, and because the suggested bias may not
/// exist, it is not implemented here.
///
/// ## Overview of the ISAAC algorithm:
/// (in pseudo-code)
///
/// ```text
/// Input: a, b, c, s[256] // state
/// Output: r[256]         // results
///
/// mix(a,i) = a ^ a << 13   if i = 0 mod 4
///            a ^ a >>  6   if i = 1 mod 4
///            a ^ a <<  2   if i = 2 mod 4
///            a ^ a >> 16   if i = 3 mod 4
///
/// c = c + 1
/// b = b + c
///
/// for i in 0..256 {
///     x = s_[i]
///     a = f(a,i) + s[i+128 mod 256]
///     y = a + b + s[x>>2 mod 256]
///     s[i] = y
///     b = x + s[y>>10 mod 256]
///     r[i] = b
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Numbers are generated in blocks of 256. This means the function above only
/// runs once every 256 times you ask for a next random number. In all other
/// circumstances the last element of the results array is returned.
///
/// ISAAC therefore needs a lot of memory, relative to other non-crypto RNGs.
/// 2 * 256 * 4 = 2 kb to hold the state and results.
///
/// This implementation uses [`BlockRng`] to implement the [`RngCore`] methods.
