//! Traits and Structs to manage interrupt sources for devices.
//!
//! In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or
//! software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor
//! to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is
//! executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and
//! executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal
//! with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes,
//! unless handling the interrupt has emitted a fatal error, the processor resumes normal
//! activities.
//!
//! Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the
//! operating system, or a bare-metal program running on the CPU if there are no OSes. The act of
//! initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an interrupt request (IRQ). Different devices
//! are usually associated with different interrupts using a unique value associated with each
//! interrupt. This makes it possible to know which hardware device caused which interrupts.
//! These interrupt values are often called IRQ lines, or just interrupt lines.
//!
//! Nowadays, IRQ lines is not the only mechanism to deliver device interrupts to processors.
//! MSI [(Message Signaled Interrupt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Signaled_Interrupts)
//! is another commonly used alternative in-band method of signaling an interrupt, using special
//! in-band messages to replace traditional out-of-band assertion of dedicated interrupt lines.
//! While more complex to implement in a device, message signaled interrupts have some significant
//! advantages over pin-based out-of-band interrupt signaling. Message signaled interrupts are
//! supported in PCI bus since its version 2.2, and in later available PCI Express bus. Some
//! non-PCI architectures also use message signaled interrupts.
//!
//! While IRQ is a term commonly used by Operating Systems when dealing with hardware
//! interrupts, the IRQ numbers managed by OSes are independent of the ones managed by VMM.
//! For simplicity sake, the term `Interrupt Source` is used instead of IRQ to represent both
//! pin-based interrupts and MSI interrupts.
//!
//! A device may support multiple types of interrupts, and each type of interrupt may support one
//! or multiple interrupt sources. For example, a PCI device may support:
//! * Legacy Irq: exactly one interrupt source.
//! * PCI MSI Irq: 1,2,4,8,16,32 interrupt sources.
//! * PCI MSIx Irq: 2^n(n=0-11) interrupt sources.
//!
//! A distinct Interrupt Source Identifier (ISID) will be assigned to each interrupt source.
//! An ID allocator will be used to allocate and free Interrupt Source Identifiers for devices.
//! To decouple the vm-device crate from the ID allocator, the vm-device crate doesn't take the
//! responsibility to allocate/free Interrupt Source IDs but only makes use of assigned IDs.
//!
//! The overall flow to deal with interrupts is:
//! * The VMM creates an interrupt manager
//! * The VMM creates a device manager, passing on an reference to the interrupt manager
//! * The device manager passes on an reference to the interrupt manager to all registered devices
//! * The guest kernel loads drivers for virtual devices
//! * The guest device driver determines the type and number of interrupts needed, and update the
//!   device configuration
//! * The virtual device backend requests the interrupt manager to create an interrupt group
//!   according to guest configuration information
