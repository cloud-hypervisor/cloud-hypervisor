//! A device model crate for virtual machine.
//!
//! This services as a base crate for concrete device crate(s) in rust-vmm.
//! It focuses on defining common traits that can/should be used by any
//! device implementation as well as providing unified interfaces for rest
//! of the rust-vmm code that works on device but does not necessarily to
//! know the implementation details of the device.
