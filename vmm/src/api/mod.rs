//! The internal VMM API for Cloud Hypervisor.
//!
//! This API is a synchronous, [mpsc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/)
//! based IPC for sending commands to the VMM thread, from other
//! Cloud Hypervisor threads. The IPC follows a command-response protocol, i.e.
//! each command will receive a response back.
//!
//! The main Cloud Hypervisor thread creates an API event file descriptor
//! to notify the VMM thread about pending API commands, together with an
//! API mpsc channel. The former is the IPC control plane, the latter is the
//! IPC data plane.
//! In order to use the IPC, a Cloud Hypervisor thread needs to have a clone
//! of both the API event file descriptor and the channel Sender. Then it must
//! go through the following steps:
//!
//! 1. The thread creates an mpsc channel for receiving the command response.
//! 2. The thread sends an ApiRequest to the Sender endpoint. The ApiRequest
//!    contains the response channel Sender, for the VMM API server to be able
//!    to send the response back.
//! 3. The thread writes to the API event file descriptor to notify the VMM
//!    API server about a pending command.
//! 4. The thread reads the response back from the VMM API server, from the
//!    response channel Receiver.
//! 5. The thread handles the response and forwards potential errors.
